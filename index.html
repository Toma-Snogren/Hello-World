<h1><strong>COVID</strong> Unit Experience</h1>
<h2>Working as a <abrr>CNA</abrr> during <strong>COVID</strong> on an <abbr>ICU COVID</abbr> Floor</h2>
<h2>Boston Medical Center</h2>
<p><strong>Boston Medical Center</strong> was one of the hospitals in the Boston area that was overwhelmed in the summer due to an influx of <abrr>COVID</abrr> patients. Many step down units, ICU, and pediatric were transformed into <strong>COVID</strong> units. Many medical staff became sick with COVID, had to move from their families to protect them, and worked extra shifts. Personel were exposed to high stress environments, with little protective equipment at the start of the pandemic.</p>
